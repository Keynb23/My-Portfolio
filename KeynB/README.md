create a page that has all of your projects
like the main page has a couple on display,
but this page is just all of your projects for 
people to see 

add snake game and pong game to projects(need screenshots)

finish nba redesign, add that.

add netflix copy

the background should slightly change or
have an animation that matches the theme of
whatever project is there

add a 3d scroll affects to all content

Maybe replace the robot with something else. Stick to a dark theme 

convert all files to regular jsx files with containers instead of state managed components. (should be done, but double check)

Seperated the styles so it's easier to find them. Some are staying in the app.css.

make every section of the page animated in some way. Scroll, hover, and onClick effects. Don't go crazy, keep it clean
